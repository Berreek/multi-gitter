Contributing Guide

We welcome dontributions in multiple forms. This file describes some of the ways how you can help out in various ways.

## Bug fixes or new feature

You would like to help out with code? Great! Before you get started, please read the following guidelines:

### General guidelines for Pull Requests

üí¨ Create a ticket discussing the change and get a confirmation that this change will be merged if built before starting your pull request. This is true for most pull requests, except for small changes such as typos.

üöß Clearly state the state of you pull requests. If the PR is not finished but you want feedback. Mark it as a draft PR.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Limit the pull requests to solve one specific task. 

‚¨áÔ∏è Create a new commit for any changes after the pull request was created. Changes will be squashed once merged. But to make the review process easier, never rewrite the history.

### Get started coding

The only dependency needed for multi-gitter development is `go`. By forking and cloning the repo you are ready to go.

### Test your code

All tests can be run with `go test ./...`. These tests will also run on multiple platforms once you push it.

### Docs

If you want to make changes to the README.md file. Please take a look in `./docs/README.template.md` since the README.md file is generated based on it. If you want to change something like the description of a flag, that change can be made directly in the code and docs will be updated automatically.

### Structure

* **cmd**: This is where the CLI is created. Everything that has to do with parsing flags or similair is done here, but no actual execution logic.
* **docs**: Documentation.
* **examples**: Example scripts that can be used together with multi-gitter.
* **internal**
  * **domain**: This folder contains basic structures that can be used by multiple packages.
  * **git**: All implementations of git.
  * **multi-gitter**: The main logic of multi-gitter. This is the code that glues everything together.
  * **scm**: Source control system implementations such as GitHub/GitLab/etc.
* **test**: Integration tests.
* **tools**: Tools for CI/CD or for development.
